Hello!
I'm very new to PC and coding, but when I built my PC, I told myself I would do something with it!
So, here's my attempt! I'm on version 4 of my Kalshi bot! I've gone from a basic desktop GUI to a Streamlit UI that has auto trading and candlesticks and open market filtering, stops and entries, etc.
 
However, I still can't get it to actually place trades successfully. I was having troubles for the longest time to actually find markets and it would keep scanning through 30400 markets which would take 2-4 minutes, then I figured out how to get it down to 16k markets and now, I can get it down to 300.
I'm also having difficulties with finding open markets, as opposed to active markets. I have no idea what I'm doing and I could sure use some help!
 
I'm sure I'm doing a bunch of stuff wrong!
 
Thank you for your time and any assistance!
